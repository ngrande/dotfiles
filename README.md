# dotfiles
Mostly dot configuration files for my user.
Also includes some other nice-to-have configurations like pacman hooks.

## Setup
simply call the setup script which will create the symlinks for you and copy everything where it belongs.
(Sudo is required since i now included the pacman system wide hooks)
